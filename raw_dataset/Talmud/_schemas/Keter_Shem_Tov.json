    "enDesc": "Keter Shem Tov is a seven-volume work on variant Jewish customs and liturgies that pays particular attention to Sephardic traditions but includes Ashkenazi customs as well. The author, Rabbi Shem Tov Ganguine, was a Sephardic rabbi who served in several positions in Egypt and England, for Ashkenazi as well as Sephardic communities. He traveled extensively, which enabled him to collect information about many lesser-known traditions. The work includes extensive footnotes referencing sources throughout rabbinic literature. The last four volumes were published posthumously by the author’s son.",
